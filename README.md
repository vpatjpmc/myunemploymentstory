choose to stand for myself and fight for my right to work and live as an American!üá∫üá∏Those who wrongfully laid me off and unlawfully unethically prevented me from being hired will be held accountable for their wrongdoings.
I have been unemployed for two years, largely due to consistently encountering biased and rigged technical interviews designed to exclude qualified candidates.

They hide behind this little fucking program called "HR Answer," which makes their arbitrary actions and wrongdoings unaccountable and untraceable. They do not even include their full names in the case they are investigating. They limit the number of words in the text field for you to respond. It is as short as a tweet and does not allow you to attach documents as proof. They arbitrarily close the investigation case whenever they want and give you no option to reopen, even if you reopen it, another person on-call can easily close it again with no consequences. It is nothing more than a tool for intimidating, bullying, and abusing employees by creating conflict through misinformation and distortion of facts, as well as giving orders/instructions to the lines of business to terminate employees. As you can see not all automation tools will do what they suppose to do. Technology can be abused by the wrong people

Some screenshots of technical issues I sent you were taken on December 17/24. Since I began being interviewed at JPMorgan last year, the response to my job applications has been significantly delayed, often for weeks or months. I need to refer back to the job post when a recruiter contacts me.It's not about job competition. It's about an unfair, unethical, dishonest and biased hiring process, as well as punishment for speaking up about it and concealing the faults of laying me off by preventing me from being hired again.  I never received answers to the following issues, which I raised in the summer 2024, but the issues have gotten worse and doubled down.I documented all issues and difficulties I encountered.  I also sent you a separate email about the incident. To summarize, please review all of the issues below that have taken away my job opportunities and blocked me from being hired.
Please address the concerns and eliminate unfair, dishonest, and biased hiring practices, as well as the hate and retaliation attempts, or forward them to your supervisor or the appropriate department for resolution..Thank you!Best,QiongThe following issues were escalated to JP Morgan Chase Employee Relations on 09/09/24.1. Why was the quality of your interviews low? Include the recruiter‚Äôs name, date of interview, comments made or questions asked, etc.Here is an example of a low-quality interview in which the interviewer is rude, irrational, unprofessional, unfair, threatening and full of hatred.I was not advised that a coding interview would require me to share my computer screen. The interview was originally set for 30 minutes, and I was told it would be with a hiring manager, who is typically a non-technical person based on my previous interview experience at JPMC.   Also, 30 minutes is too short for a coding session. So I didn't join the interview from my computer but my phone. On May 6, 2024, at 7:41 AM, the recruiter contacted me via email, saying,  ‚ÄúThe manager has requested to extend the interview an additional 30 minutes..‚Äù  See the following. When I woke up and received his email, it was less than an hour till my interview, and I still didn't know if there was a coding round that needed me to show my screen.Then Dhira Kaleeswaran and another individual joined the zoom.  I was informed that another individual without her camera on will conduct the coding interview for Dhira Kaleeswaran. They required me to share my computer screen.  Asking candidates to share their screen for a coding interview without giving advance notice is very disrespectful about the candidate's data privacy and security.  I was shocked that she works in the security domain, yet doesn't seem to care about others' data privacy and security. I have taken numerous professional technical coding interviews, including FAANG, and I have never been asked to share my screen, let alone share it without giving notice.Not only am I uncomfortable sharing my screen unprepared in an unsafe manner, but I also had an internet connectivity issue with my computer, so I asked Dhira Kaleeswaran if I could reschedule. She started to blame me and nearly yelled at me during the interview for not being able to join the Zoom coding session from my computer because of technical difficulties.  She even unreasonably brought the HR interview scheduler on the call to try to resolve my wifi issue.  She was rude and insane, suggesting that I either complete the interview today no matter what or be removed from consideration. Of course, the HR scheduler had no idea how to address my wifi issue. Like me, she didn't seem to know what this interview was about or what needed to be prepared for the interview. As a result, the interview couldn't proceed and couldn't be rescheduled, my application was no longer being considered. I received the rejection email almost immediately after I got off the zoom call with them. I‚Äôve never met her before and knew nothing about her. There is no reason for her to act crazy like a hater, unless she was told to.Hi Qiong,The manager has request to extend the interview an additional 30 minutes. Just wanted to keep you posted on this. Please keep in mind that they may not need the full hour however they wanted to extend the interview just in case.Thanks,Joseph Carrion |Senior Technology Recruiter - Global Technology Recruitment

Any other examples where interviews were biased or you were treated unfairly?Aside from the other reasons/examples stated in the answers to the rest of the questions 1, 2, 3, 5, 6: The quality of my interviews is low. The hiring process was delayed, resulting in positions being filled before my interview could begin. My candidacy was dropped, and my scheduled interviews were canceled without explanation on the interview day, even though I had already joined the Zoom call and was about to begin my interview. Here are three additional examples:A. Someone from the HR department changed my applicant profile and employment history at JPMC.  I was employed as a VP with full-time employment in 2021 and I was NEVER hired as a contractor or associate engineer, but I've been informed by multiple recruiters that they saw my profile as an associate engineer and a contractor.  I've been applying for jobs at JPMC almost everyday and always have a current resume on my profile, so why has my employment history become something else that I have never put on my resume? Who did that?B. I no longer receive updates on my interview status. I have not heard back from any recruiters on the interviews I had since June 2024. When I asked when I could expect to hear the interview results, one of my interviewers said they didn't know because once they made the selection, it's up to HR to decide when to arrange the next round.  I could have been selected from any earlier interviews, but they never kept me updated and scheduled the next round, thus I was never moved forward. I wrote multiple emails to vernadette.j.caga@jpmorgan.com and stephanie.colunga@jpmchase.com asking about application status but did not receive response.C. Furthermore, there are strong indications that someone is attempting to keep me from being hired by undermining teams who wanted to interview me by purposely delaying their interview requests until after I have responded to any additional unexpected requests in order to send me to interviews where interviewers will never choose me at all. They've been doing this for months. The same pattern appears repeatedly. It's difficult to believe it wasn't true.D.  Interviewers do not appear to be qualified for the positions for which they are conducting interviews. The most recent example is that I was scheduled for an interview for a Senior VP position (210540185 | Senior Lead Software Engineer - Python) with an interviewer whose job title is an associate engineer, not even a VP. Please see the interview info below. How can someone make a good hiring decision for a position he or she does not have enough experience with? The only explanation is that the aim of this interview is to reject me rather than hiring me. I believe that this is also the cause for the poor quality of my recent ongoing interviews. My questions are, who sent an associate engineer to interview for a VP position, and why?5. Who would not respond to you after offering a week of your availability?Many of my interviews were scheduled at the end of the last available day I provided, leaving me with no time to prepare for the interview. I sometimes have to email the recruiter again to see if my availability is still working for them after not hearing back from them till the end of my last available day. Not every interview is scheduled once I give my availability, and there's no explanation. Most recruiters do not contact me directly to explain roles or answer questions. Most of the time, schedulers send me an interview request inquiring for my availability without telling me who the recruiter is. Sometimes my provided availability was totally ignored without explanation. My interview was delayed to be scheduled, and they chose a day at random without even asking about my new availability.I gave my availability from 6/26/24 to 6/28/24, 10am - 4pm CDT  to the recruiter Guzman, Trisha" <trisha.guzman@chase.com> , but the interview was scheduled on 07/03/24.

Thank you!I've had at least 20 interviews at JPMC since March 2024, but the quality of the interviews and recruitment process has continuously deteriorated. Now it is highly unprofessional and biased, which results in me losing numerous opportunities, financially and mentally suffering because I'm putting so much time and money into preparing the interviews for months and months yet being unfairly treated in the hiring process, leading me to believe that I was purposefully blocked from being hired by HR personnel due to my prior employment at the JPMC, as I was laid off for no apparent reason shortly after receiving a performance raise for resolving a critical technical issue in three days that no one had been able to resolve for a year.Here are some of the issues I have experienced:1.  Interviewers do not appear to be qualified for the positions for which they are conducting interviews. The most recent example is that I was scheduled for an interview for a Senior VP position (210540185 | Senior Lead Software Engineer - Python) with an interviewer whose job title is an associate engineer, not even a VP. Please see the interview info below. How can someone make a good hiring decision for a position he or she does not have enough experience with? The only explanation is that the aim of this interview is to reject me rather than employ me, but whoever assigned this associate engineer to interview for a senior VP position couldn't find a manager or engineer willing to lie for him or her throughout the interview and reject me. I believe that this is also the cause for the poor quality of my recent ongoing interviews.

The quality of my interviews are extremely low, with the clear purpose of removing my candidacy. Despite having had over 20 interviews, the majority of which were for technical roles, there are very few technical interviews. Most of the time, I've been interviewed and rejected by interviewers that don't have a software engineer or any other technical experience, with questions like "where I was born" and "what do I like to do when I'm not working". At some interviews, the interviewer's questions and description of job requirements are completely different from the requirements in the job posting, which fits great in my experience.3. Delayed hiring process, resulting in positions being filled before my interview even begins. The delay is usually somewhere between 1- 4 weeks.  After offering a week of my full-day availability to the recruiter or scheduler who requested, I may not hear anything back.  If you check in with them, they may or may not inform you that they need you to update your availability in the last minute of your provided availability.4. My candidacy was dropped, and my scheduled interviews were canceled without explanation on the interview day when I already joined the Zoom call and was about to have my interview .5. Someone in your department changed my applicant profile and employment history at JPMC.  I was employed as a VP with full-time employment in 2021 and I was NEVER hired as a contractor or associate engineer, but I've been informed by multiple recruiters that they saw my profile as an associate engineer and a contractor.  I've been applying for jobs at JPMC almost everyday and always have a current resume on my profile, so why has my employment history become something else that I have never put on my resume? Who did that?6. Strangely, recent interview requests beginning in April 2024 have consistently requested at the same time. There are always two or more requests that follow one another closely, almost as if they are competing. If I didn't move forward with one of them, the other interview requests would disappear.7. I no longer receive updates on my interview status. I have not heard back from any recruiters on the interviews I had in June 2024. When I asked when I could expect to hear the interview results, one of my interviewers said they didn't know because once they made the selection, it's up to HR to decide when to arrange the next round. Could you help update my interview status for all the interviews I had back in June 2024?For item 2 - 7, I can provide more details and examples with 5W(who, what, where, when, why) and 1H(How) if neededThe problems got worse. I continue to experience unprofessional, biased, dishonest, or even scam-like processes.üì∑devqm <prowork.dev1010@gmail.com>
Nov 8, 2024, 11:06‚ÄØAMüì∑üì∑üì∑to Anishüì∑Hi Anish,I wanted to follow up on our last communication about the issues I encountered during the hiring process. You advised me that I would receive a response in a few weeks, but it has been more than 2 months(3 months since submitting my initial request) and I still have not received anything. I'm wondering if you have any updates?  I'm still experiencing issues with the hiring process. See below.Last week, Trisha Guzman, the recruiter called me on the phone.  I was stunned when she said my name as "Qiong Michaels Jeremy." I had previously mentioned in my email that someone had modified my employment history, but now it appears they've also changed my name in my profile as well? Had she not seen my resume? I've spoken with countless recruiters throughout the years. Never before has anyone called me without even knowing my name. I'd think she received incorrect information somewhere. Where is the incorrect information from?Also, the job description was removed prior to the interview, but I was not provided any information other than the job title for which I am interviewing. My interviewer informed me that I was interviewing for a position on the forensic team. I don't recall seeing any job descriptions for the position I applied for that mentioned forensics. Despite the fact that the interviewer stated that this is still an engineering role and that I answered his questions well, I'm still concerned if the job description was changed on the fly, so the add-on forensic topic would be used as an excuse to reject me. I have not heard back from the recruiter after the interview.Since I was wrongfully laid off in 2022, I've been applying for most software engineering-related positions almost every day, at least once a week or two, for about two years, and I have over ten years of experience, as well as so many teams(around 20-30) interested in interviewing me, how could I not be qualified for anything and be hired already? Are they all mistaken in selecting me, or are there HR personnel that continually prevent me from being hired?  Which one is more obvious to you? There are also other leadership positions on the development team. Why have I been repeatedly denied for those positions and instead selected for positions where I barely have expertise?Based on the issues I raised in my previous email and above, it has occurred to me that individuals deliberately preventing me from being hired by the firm are most likely working at the Human Resources department.  Because none of the technical teams I interviewed for knew me, why would they reject me on purpose for no reason? The only individuals who knew me from the start (Even though I didn't know anyone at HR when I worked there, I wasn't sure why they wanted to fight me, unless they were some horrible soulless individuals who would hurt anyone to spread their hatred and jealousy) were the ones who wrongfully laid me off, and they have yet to be held accountable for what they did.  Because if they had, they would have stopped blocking from being hired already.I would appreciate it if the firm can sort this out and stop such dishonest, unkind and aggressive behavior directed at me and possibly other employees. I still hope the firm will change for the better, and I would like to return to work.  Could you please let me know when I can expect an answer?  Thank you.devqm <prowork.dev1010@gmail.com>

Hi Anish,
Could you please explain how each of the submitted issues was addressed by Employee Relationships?
Since I submitted the request, the frequency of being selected for interviews has dropped dramatically from every week before to only one in the last 3 months, and some of the issues I submitted appear to be worsening rather than improving. In my most recent conversation with a recruiter Trisha Guzman, the recruiter called me with the wrong name on my candidate profile. How did this occur? Can you explain it in detail? Thanks.
Best,
Qiong

Hi Anish,
I just wanted to follow up on the issue I communicated with you in my last email. I just caught this scheduler Aditi Nag lying by alleging I didn't show up for the interview, which is almost hilarious given that he clearly responded to my email I sent to him on the interview day, telling him I was waiting for the interviewer till the last minute, but no one joined the Zoom call. (see the email below or the attachment).  He did not respond until two days later with the email below, attempting to blame me by pretending I was not available for the interview.  Is there anything you can do to stop such hostile behavior? I don't even know him and anyone else working in your HR department. Why do they keep sabotaging my interviews and attacking me?
Best,
Qiong

Hey Anish,
I no longer can see the positions I applied for.  My candidate profile page no longer works.  What is happening?  I received a server error message stating "Something went wrong.Try again later." It's been there for weeks now. Please see the attached screenshots.

Hi,
I wanted to follow up with the profile issue I had earlier. It is still not resolved. I'm not able to see job applications on my candidate profile.
See attached screenshots.  Furthermore,the recruiting has become worse, and it seems to be a scam. Despite providing my availability to the recruiter months ago, and the recruiter stated she will send an invite for an interview, my interview was never scheduled. Instead, I just received a rejection email indicating they had interviewed me and thanked me for meeting them?!!!!
Best,
QiongDuring my most recent interview, It seemed the interviewers did not see my resume. They didn't even know my name and called me "Michelle". Of course, they had no idea that I specialized in software development. Three people asked me the same question. I explained three times, saying, "I developed features, fixed bugs, and resolved any production issues for the applications," which is standard software development practice, so the hiring manager would at least know if they were looking for a senior lead software engineer . However, they did not appear to have read my resume or even known I'm specialized in software development. After I had answered the same questions three times, one of the interviewers finally understood it was an agile process.They appear to be hardware professionals working at a data center. I'm surprised I was chosen for a data center position in which I may not have any prior experience. However, HR has done it before, most recently sending me to an interview for a digital forensics position. But I have not been interviewed for any software development positions, particularly in Python, where I have extensive knowledge and experience.One of the recruiters informed me that they could not offer me a salary as high as my present rate as a software developer lead since the position was not in software development. An analogy for this type of unethical recruiting scam would be terminating doctors and then asking them if they want to work as waiters or have no job . Are we truly short on skilled software engineers and need to look for them abroad while wrongfully laying off experienced good engineers and preventing them from being hired through unethical dishonest biased recruiting process? I fixed technical issues generated by the engineers abroad due to a lack of expertise in my previous position at JPMorgan, yet I was laid off shortly after that. They still had jobs after I was laid off.  Please explain why?Interview for SR Lead Software Engineer - JPMorgan Chase

I am a senior software engineer, and ex-Googler, with a proven track record of making significant and self-directed contributions to challenging and complex large-scale enterprise backend API services and infrastructure components.
This journey has equipped me with versatile skills in full-stack development, cloud computing, CI/CD pipeline configuration, infrastructure automation, identify/access managment, SSL/TLS Security, implementing monitoring solutions, handling log analysis, system administration, network automation and more.
I am passionate about coding and highly proficient in Python and OOP programming, with a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures. Additionally, I have practical experience in architecture and system design.
Pleasure to collaborate with, and work alongside skilled and professional peers.
Cheers!
Sorry for the cursing below but I stand by everything I've said on this post. This is exactly what they did.
The truth may not always be pleasant, but it is still preferable than lies almost at all times.
"The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing"
Even though I am broke and may die as a result of my odds, I'm not going to give up!
FUCK ALL PIGS TRYING TO RUIN OUR FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY!
If any of you want to join the fight because you are fed up being scammed by the Indians behind the screens, bitched by those sneaky barstards from the HR of those organizations, bullied/blocked online by their tech partners when you are looking for jobs to apply, looking to connect with people online, looking for good services/products, etc., Whether you are an engineer, executive, lawyer, banker, or even an HR professional, let's talk or meet to see if you can help me in any way, so I can keep fighting them until we get things right, so there will be no more victims!
I haven't had any job offers in a year since my last job. After being scammed/fakely interviewed at least 2-3 time a week for almost a year, my pain starts to become anger, I simply want to spew out all of the reasons why I still haven't landed a job?! It's not all about competitions!
These are the main causes. There are horrible horrible folks in these organizations below(Even the officers from my unemployment agency frowned on their lying). They should be held accountable for rigging the job market, committing fraud, bullying employees, racism, corrupting competitions/interviews and creating a toxic workplace/culture...
The worst of all is they have an ability to fire/lay off people as they please. There are no equal opportunity, no performance-based metrics/methods, and even if they exist, they can easily change your performance by working with their favorite teams to give you a difficult time at work by denying you the resources/access you need to execute your job, as well as cutting off information sharing and collaboration. That was exactly what happened to me at JPMC. My performance has dramatically changed in a short period of time. I was like a goose chaser chasing teammates from oversea teams for weeks/months for the access/resources I needed to finish my tasks. My manager was attempting to help me as he noticed the issue but before he can resolve it. He became preoccupied with a soon-to-be toxic new work environment as a group of people, including a product manager, a product owner, an architect, tech leads (at least 3-4, and leads were continually replacing or promoting due to conflicts and disagreements.), 2-3 agility leads and 3 or more junior developers/interns, were abruptly added to our team. So I gave up and wanted to be transfered to a different team. I applied internal jobs and had multiple interviews with a few teams, and they all seemed to want me, but it all ended at HR. As they mentioned, I was not yet at the one-year employment mark and need my manager's approval. So I wrote a request to HR and tried to get my manager's approval. Not only did HR not handle my request, but they also somehow created a conflict between me and my manager. I had no issue with my manager. My manager is a good manager. He treated everyone equally with respect and recognized my performance when I addressed a critical project issue and rewarded me with a raise. The reason I wanted to move to another team is definitly not because of him. I never complained about my manager, and I still thanked him when I left. I felt sorry for both him and my original teammates. Somehow, I felt that the mess started because of me. I somehow gave drama queens opportunities to make a drama. After months of working in a toxic environment, I couldn't take it any longer and went on leave. Then I got all the negative stuff an employee could possibly get from the HR(As I recall, the written warning prevented me from taking offers from other teams). Not only was I unable to accept offers from other teams after reaching my one-year mark, but the manager was forced to lay me off and let go other original team contributors later after the new project was cancelled.
Original team members(5 of us), including myself, are required to put down all of our responsibilities/tasks for developing and maintaining/fixing the current project, which had been ongoing for over 5 years (and they surely can't abandon the project, since many teams were using our project to manage and deploy their SSL certificates. I'm not sure what they did with the project, but it was presumably given to another team) and begin working on the tasks assigned to us by numerous leads, architech, product manager, and product owner. It was a mess! I've never seen a team structured like that at anywhere I worked. Within a couple of months, the project was canceled without even a complete architectual diagram. Everyone that includes me was either transferred to another team, or joined another company after being laid off for no reason.
How do teams become HR's favorite teams? Because many teams are made up of low-wage foreign workers who are most likely on employer-sponsored visas or work from oversea. As a result, they are unable to negotiate their salary and must agree with whatever HR requires, even if those requirements are unethical, illicit, or even illegal.
That is why foreign workers are the HR department's preferred candidates, especially for senior management/lead positions. It's not just that they can be easily exploited, they're also "loyal" to HR. Note, I'm not saying all foreign workers are awful! They are also victims of HR if it is a bad HR as I have described.
Mow your lawn, HR drama queens need to go:
Fire or lay them off, so that professinonal workers can return to work! Because they will never change their behaviors.They have practiced numerous methods to ruin employees, teams, eventually departments/companies, and they have also formed their own network to do so, both inside or outside the company. When they spread out like weeds, the situation gets worse, and all the shit ways of treating people/making drama are handed down. The weeds' roots must be removed to stop them.
Get rid of the top 10+ drama queens at HR, and you will notice a significant improvement in the poor culture and work force, I promise!
Hopefully, all of these nightmares will come to an end and we will be able to return to work.
********************************** FAANG Interviews **********************************
The overall coding interview duration is 45 minutes, however at least 5 minutes must be spent before the interview questions and 5 minutes afterward for the candidate to ask questions. So the actual coding time is 35 minutes or less, depending on how your luck goes. Correct me if I'm wrong. The candidate will have a maximum of 17 minutes and 30 seconds to finish the questions only if the introduction and post questions take no more than 10 minutes. I timed myself to just type out an optimal solution for a medium level question without thinking and without making any mistakes. It takes me about 5 minutes, but if the question is partly written, the candidate is more likely have to ask the interviewer to elaborate and clarify it, which could add at least a few minutes. Let's assume 3 minutes is the minimum; if the interviewer asks you to describe your thoughts and solution while you're coding, that's at least another 3 minutes talk. So this means you have a maximum of 6 minutes to think about your solution, this also includes reviewing any errors you made after you write your solution. Forget about processing from brutal force to best solution. Just write down the best solution as fast as you can.
If your interview situation is as mentioned above, or even better (they will need to bend a rule for you), and you have excellent coding abilities, you should be able to come up with the best solution, write it down, review it, and debug it in 11 minutes or less, You might get your dream job with a great salary. However, if you look carefully, you'll notice that many aspects are outside your control, and they have a significant impact on whether you win or lose. It's like winning the lottery: more than half of your chances depend on luck and how much they like you. Here's why:
1. The introductory talk could be longer or shorter. It's not up to you.
2. Each solution for each question could more/less than 5 minutes of typing without thinking and making any mistakes.Medium-level Leetcode problems may be appropriate, but tbh I doubt answers for most hard leetcode problems require less than 5 minutes of typing. What questions you get depends on your luck. I mean, if the solutions to two questions take more than 10 minutes of typing, you're practically out of luck, it's difficult to finish on time by anyone.
3. If questions are half written down without even a few samples of input and output, you'll need time to ask for all the details. Add that to your luck.
4.There isn't time to explain the solution to the interviewer. If you get the correct answer and have to explain it to the interviewer and walk through it before you can solve the next problem, you won't have time to solve the following one. Take a look at the time of actions listed above and calculate it yourself. You might be out of luck!
5. Hopefully, you have an intervewer who is articulate and speaks at a good pace , getting straight to the point without misunderstanding you. Misunderstanding each other in a heated moment like this might freeze or fry your brain. Good luck! : )
Do the interviews with FAANG if :
* You want to beat your ego *
I used to work at Google. The first thing I heard from the tech lead was that they didn't care about algorithms or data structures. They forgot about it after they left school. I also confirmed this with my FAANG interviewers. Their projects do not make extensive use of the algo/data structures for which you are being tested. Do not get me wrong. Set aside algo/data structures, it's an useful test for your coding skills, as being able to code out the problem in almost unreasonable amount of time requires excellent coding skills. If you pass it, you may have better coding skills than many other engineers in other companies that are less demanding in the coding interview. Because, if you pass, you may have set a new benchmark. Yay! I have interviewed for L4/SDEIII at Google, Principal at Amazon and E6 Meta.
The interview with Meta the second time was awful and extremely unprofessional. They lied to me. I had an interview with them three months ago and have yet to pass the waiting period. A recruiter contacted me, asking if I wanted to be interviewed again. I told her on the phone that I had an interview three months ago and was still waiting. She mentioned that the interviewer was impressed with my performance in the last interview, so they wanted to give me another chance. I accepted the invitation and postponed everything I was doing for weeks, including moving, applying for other jobs, in order to focus solely on studying for the interview, and even had a mock interview with them.(The mock interivew was fantastic. As with my previous interview three months ago, the interviewer for the mock interview was incredibly experienced and knowledgeable. I learned a lot about the coding interview for this round.) Then a few days before the interview, they told me I'm not illegible after I told them I would like to apply to a L5/E5 that could make it easier for me to pass the interview.Because I was tested twice during their interviews, I was able to solve at least one problem; unlike L6/E6, L5/E5 may only have one or two to solve. If the interviewer asks less questions after I have given the correct answer, and I explain my optimal solution to the first problem more quickly, as well as walk through it quickly(you are not supposed to run the code to test it), I might have enough time to complete the second problem if I can solve it. It seemed they didn't want to give me a chance to pass. That is why they didn't place me on a appropriate level in the first place, and why they changed their minds and made my status illegible again when I informed them that I wanted to apply to L5/E5. They seemed to want me to choose either complete the harder one L6/E6 or wait 9 months to apply for a low-paying job that I am unlikely to be interested in. Because I chose to apply L5/E5, I lost the opportunity to be interviewed now.
Another thing to keep in mind is that they will request you to rate their recruiting process at the beginning, not at the end of the process and the rating form will expire even before your schedule your mock interview. Of course, every candidate will most likely give them a positive rating because the opportunity was provided. So did I. However, to me it turned out to be a complete waste of my time and money, which deserves zero star. Honestly, I felt like being scammed in some way and I probaby won't recommend to anyone to apply.
I'm not sure about Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, or Nvidia because I never received an interview invitation regardless of the level of SDE I applied for. lol. I feel burned out, and I honestly don't believe I'm their preferred person to hire. If they wanted to recruit me, they would have discussed a suitable position and compensation. The pay I sought for is far from their top tier, but rather around L4/5 for someone with strong coding abilities and 10+ years of IT experience. It is not unreasonable, but unfornately it has never worked out with any of their FTE positions.
* They like you for some reason(most important), not your skills/experience *
I hate to say this, but I bet it's true.
HR has a significant impact on the coding interview process. Because, as discussed above, the quality of your interviewer (speed, clarity, variety of questions, etc.) is critical to your success. The problem is that if your HR coordinator can choose which interviewer to interview you, obviously they can influence the outcome of the interview. The HR process is designed to facilitate the interview process but not to make business decisions or affect on the outcome of the interviews.
Similarly to how the interview questions must be carefully chosen, pre-approved, and confidential until the interview time arrives, the interviewer should be treated in the same way to ensure the process is not biased and modified away from the design. By automating the process with automated tools, it is possible that HR will not need to know the name of the interviewer and interviewee while requesting, arranging interviews and passing on the feedback.
Scams exist because of ambiguous and confusing rules/process. Perhaps by doing so, businesses will be able to effectively prevent frauds, bias, and corrupted interivews inside the fuzzy hiring process in the labor market, as well as tear down the wall formed by the flawed HR procedure. I believe there are many talented and skilled people in our countries, and our companies simply need to reform/improve the current hiring process to provide fair opportunities for all and save the labor market from being destroyed by favoritism, unfair competition, and a corrupted/manipulated hiring process.
FAANG jobs often do not involve considerable understanding of algorithms/data or Leetcode problem solving techniques. You are studying a different skill set only for the sake of passing the interview. If you pass, you could get the job if they like you. If you don't, they can hire someone else who did not pass the interview to do the same job. This gives an excuse not to hire someone with exceptional coding abilities who might fail the exam due to a lack of "the luck" discussed above, but they can still hire those with none or very limited knowledge of algorithms/data structures who doesn't have exceptional coding abilities as required in the interview and will almost certainly fail the coding test or workers of any quality to do the job through various types of hiring, as long as they are on the fav list/hiring agenda. However, the quality of the code could make a significant difference. That's where most bugs originate from. Because of faulty logic/design/architecture/configeration, the code frequently needs to be rewritten entirely, and the impact could be massive if the code is released and used elsewhere. Not to mention the security flaws/vulnerabilities that bugs produce.
* You can afford expensive Lottery tickets *
If you are young, time and money aren't a major concern. Then find FAANG companies that like you and can offer you a fair opportunity in the long interview process, then it can be worth spending months/years to study something you will not use much at work and look for a result.

************************************JPMC Interviews*************************************
HR == Don't forget the TOXIC Drama Queen!
I'm wondering if HR selects my resume and then sends it to the teams they choose for me, or if teams receive my resume as soon as I apply? While the latter option would be better, it appears that the first choice. Because that is what happened below. I've also noticed that the interviewers for all of the teams I've interviewed with are all Indians and oddly my interviews with non-Indian interviewers were all canceled due to unknown reasons. Someone appears to be creating drama by putting me on the interviews with hiring managers who show little interest in me during the interview or having me interview with someone who is hostile/crazy thus creating drama between me and Indians.
March, 2024
I've been interivewed for a month with almost 10 teams.
Here we go:
I'm curious why they keep removing job postings where I'd be a good fit soon after I applied but put me in interviews for jobs that aren't even in my typical stack or canceled the job without explanation after the resume was evaluated, offer was discussed and interviews was scheduled, and why they are delaying hiring process while quickly filling positions where I'd be a good fit and the hiring teams are very interested in interviewing me.
They removed many job postings I applied but didn't update my status. Strangely, those removed job postings are still in my active job application list with the status of "Under Review" on their site, but when I click on them, I get a page saying that the position is no longer available.
If you do not want me to apply for your jobs, then do not interfere with my interviews/job search/networking and don't ever touch my linkedin again(Tell your partner to recover my linkedin account or let me create a new one)
It's difficult to tell what the job is from their generic job postings. Not to mention what the requirements are. Got rejected from the interviews were not technical nor professional. I received an illegal question, such as "where I was born". Dang!
[ I've lived in the states for nearly as long as I've lived in my birthplace. America is my second home and my country, where I received my advanced education‚Äîthe best education of my life. It seems I became a citizen a long time ago, and I don't recall all of the oaths in the ceremony, but I do remember some words: "Our traditions are your traditions." "Your traditions are ours..." One of the most important traditions I learnt here that I will never forget is "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness". It has become a tradition for me since I first learnt it, and it will continue to be so for as long as I live, despite the fact that I have to fight my way to keep them from being destroyed by either bitches/scrumbags here or outside of the country. Because I love and really believe in the traditions that built this country, which has protected all of us and provided incredible opportunities for all of us, whether born here or arrived here legally, and it is possible to make an amazing life here through hard work and talent but not via theft, scam, bullying, or racism, as long as we continue to honor the traditions. This may not be possible in other countries. That's why we do not want evil individuals, organizations, or governments to take our traditions away from us. ]
May 6, 2024:
Just had an extremely low-quality ridiculous interview:
I was interviewed as a lead with a security engineer manager Dhira Kaleeswaran and her technical assistant(Another person will perform the coding interview for her) for her team at Plano, TX.
The interviewer blamed me and nearly yelled at me during the interview for not being able to join the Zoom coding session because of technical difficulties(I was able to only join from my phone) and for not knowing that I needed to share my computer screen in order to continue with the interview. When I asked if I could reschedule due to the technical issues and unexpected requirements, she brought the HR interview scheduler on the call to resolve the technical concerns. She seemed very unreasonable/insane, suggesting that I either complete the interview today no mattter what or be removed from consideration. Of course, the HR scheduler had no idea what or how to address the technical issue. Like me, she didn't seem to know what this interview was about or what the prerequisites were for the interview. As a result, the interview couldn't proceed and couldn't be rescheduled, my application was no longer being considered.
I only had 30 minutes to meet with the hiring manager, so I never thought about the possibility of a coding session‚Äîthat wouldn't be appropriate for a professional interview as it'd be way too short if adding an coding session. Even though I was given very short notice via email (an hour or so before the interview) that they might extend the interview to an hour if needed, but I was still not told if I needed to prepare in any manner for screen sharing or for any other reason.  How am I supposed to know what I should do to prepare for the unexpected new interview requirements?
In addition, asking candidates to share their screen in order to move forward with the coding interview without providing advance notice is very disrespectful about the candidate's data privacy and security. I have taken numerous professional technical coding interviews, including FAANG, and I have never been asked to share my screen‚Äîin fact, I don't even have screen sharing software installed on my computer(and I will not allow anyone complete disk/folder access to my computer remotely without being properly prepared). How is it possible that a security team manager has no concerns about personal data security and privacy?
Clearly, she has no intention of hiring me and rather wanted to embarrass/insult me by assuming she will succeed if I am unprepared. Another thing to note is that my subsequent rounds of interviews with her supervisors (senior managers and executives) were already scheduled prior to hers. The next round is normally scheduled once you pass the current interview. This indicates that managers, executives, leaders, and engineers at the bank are confident in my abilities, either because they have seen my code (I used to work there and wrote a lot of code) or because they are familiar with me/my code from previous jobs I've had, and I've also been talking at the interviews there over the last month with many other teams. However, it was shocking to me, and probably to them, that the interviewer for this round acted in such an unprofessional and very strange way. I had never met her before and knew nothing about her. There is no need for her to do such things unless she has been told to do so or she is mentally unstable : (
4/30/2024 - 6/11/24
I believe JPMC has decent recruiters, however the "Drama Queens" mentioned above continue to make it difficult for talented/experienced people to get hired. They were trying so hard, it became exceedingly evident that they were doing awful things they are not supposed to do and should be held accountable for their wrongdoings. Below is what has been going on.
There have always been two teams, each with a recruiter reaching out to me one after the other, as if they were competing to hire me. However, one team is serious about hiring me, while the other team is only interested in sabotaging my interview and preventing me from being recruited by the other team. This happened in the exact same way 3 times now. Usually the team looking to hire me has contacted me first, then shortly after completing my recruiter call and awaiting an interview to be scheduled, another recruiter from another team will approach me for a separate position. If I don't respond to the second/fake interview invitation, the fake interview recruiter will pursue me like boys chasing girl, pestering me with emails/cold calling me, and despite the fact that I have not confirmed my interest in the position, she will continue proceed regardless and have the scheduler contact me to inquiry about my availability. This is not a typical/normal behavior for a recruiter? Finally, if I do not succeed in the interview with the first team, the phony interview recruiter will abruptly stop pursuing me, despite the fact that I expressed interest in their job offer, and no interviews will be scheduled. This is definitely not normal! All of this chasing is obviously geared on stopping my interviews with the first team. This happened 3 times in a row in the past month. Unbelievable!
I apologize for listing everyone involved in the process, however, sometimes if we want to find out the truth and address the issues, so that more people can be hired and being treated equally and respectfully, we may need to record everything so that we can analyze it and determine what happened and why. If you ever catch "Drama Queen" doing something wrong, they'll claim they didn't know anything and were making foolish mistakes by accident, but why do so many stupid mistakes keep happening?! As a result, those who should be hired are not getting hired. The work that should be done is not being completed. Should businesses continue to pay for repeated foolish mistakes? Should everyone else continue to waste their time and be traumatized as a result of all the nonsense? Or should we change that? Stop the lies/scams and nonsense, and hold the drama queens accountable for their actions. Return to normal working environment and culture! Can someone please help fix the harassing shit? Just fire or isolate the drama queens who have no skills and can do nothing but make drama, harrass people and prevent them from performing their job tasks or being hired to do the job.
How many dirty tricks/interview scams do I have to take? When will this shit end? Why can't these filthy cunts/douches be fired for destroying other people's lives? How many good employees were unjustly fired due of them, and their career was damaged in their corrupt networks(organizations with which they have a partnership or for whom they previously worked. I'm not sure if anyone has worked for JPMC their entire career. Most people have worked at other companies before joining, unless they are interns with no job experience). You'll be surprised at how they collude with one another.
Over the past three years, I have dealt with trash like this. It's difficult, in my opinion, not to curse at those. I apologized for that! They appear to be non-human, only wanting the worst to happen to people and not giving anyone any break. Anyone could become misanthropic if having to put up with their shit for very long.

Stef, the recruiter, called me at 1:37pm CDT on Friday, 08/02/204, and asked if she could schedule the interview at 9am CDT instead of 10am CDT, which I gave to her earlier. I accepted. Shortly after receiving her interview invitation, I almost immediately received another invite from team2(Delgado, Marie Fe C mariefe.c.delgado@chase.com to:devqm prowork.dev1010@gmail.com cc:"Werde, Zachary" zachary.werde@jpmchase.com date:Aug 2, 2024, 12:14‚ÄØPM) This is certainly a repeating pattern and not a coincidence anymore. It is recurring because it was successful. I won't be able to get hired if they manipulate the procedure. Brilliant people in JPMC! Let some stupid HR assholes dictate your business!
I thought it would be a technical interview because it was scheduled for an hour, but it was not. I asked one of the interviewers when I could expect to go through the final technical round if I was selected. He advised it is up to HR to decide a time. I was surprised because I had been told by recuiters from HR that it depends on the interviewers' availability. Primary interview question: a list of the libraries and dependencies I utilized for my project a year ago. They don't seem to have reviewed my r√©sum√©. They were not aware that, as a result of my employment with JPMorgan, I had not worked for a year following my termination from Bank of America. How am I expected to recall that? Why am I required to remember all of that? As a matter of fact I've never been asked a question like that. That explains, I suppose, why it was a non-technical interview that was arranged by HR once more, the same HR that set up my wrongful layoff, over a year of unemployment because I was blacklisted in their shit HR network, and my stress at work in the toxic environment they created, as well as my year-long illness/survival from COVID after being scammed into traveling to New York for a day's in-person interview for a "good paid" job that lasts less than 8 months. So it's nothing wrong to get my well-paying job back, and tell those cruel mean folks that they can't keep getting away from their wrongdoings to hurt people who have less privilege than them.

The interviewer questions are completely different than the requirements in the job description. I was not asked about my Python experiences at all but in the job description it requires advanced Python experience. I was asked if I have build Saas application from the scratch then he mentioned this is not a traditional software development work. It's a little bit everything: design, develop, config, onboard, secure applications, security engineer, etc. He said no one has ever done this before and no pattern to follow, you need to create your own solutions. Even though the requirements in the description are quite clear about the skills/experience needed, he couldn't clarify the requirements as he mentioned the project doesn‚Äôt even exist yet. It sounded much like the new project they started and moved everyone from my old team to the project, then the project canceled shortly due to no requirements or unachievable requirements and laid off everyone. It's clear that whoever is responsible for this BS only knows how to do things in a certain way by following a pattern. That's presumably why the same BS continues popping up. However, do we have to keep taking such BS? Why can't anyone stop it?
Lead Security Engineer (210500411) position!

As of today, 08/16, nothing is scheduled. I recently received an email from the scheduler, not the recruiter, after posting the status on here. Again, there is always a delay, especially when the recruiter's contact information is missing from the initial email, but she cannot hide herself **"Colunga, Stephanie" stephanie.colunga@jpmchase.com**in the following interview confirmation. People don't normally hide themselves, unless they do something bad. I'm also surprised to see only one interviewer and he is not a manager, not even a VP. Are the HR drama queens running out of high-level connections in the engineering teams? They couldn't find a manager or VP willing to support their BS. So they can just assign anyone, including unqualified interviewers, to reject you?! Only ONE associate engineer will interview senior VP candidates and determine the outcome!!! That's how their stupid evil minds work. I bet they'd want to ask their cousins to interview me if they can. Because they can't find any decent individual or a real engineer to lie for them!

Hi Surphina,
I'm traveling at this moment and my schedule is kinda unpredictable and I would prefer to communicate via email. I check my email frequently and reply as soon as I can.
I've had at least 20 interviews at JPMC since March 2024, but the quality of the interviews and recruitment process has continuously deteriorated. Now it is highly unprofessional and biased, which results in me losing numerous opportunities, financially and mentally suffering because I'm putting so much time and money into preparing the interviews for months and months yet being unfairly treated in the hiring process, leading me to believe that I was purposefully blocked from being hired by HR personnel due to my prior employment at the JPMC, as I was laid off for no apparent reason shortly after receiving a performance raise for resolving a critical technical issue in three days that no one had been able to resolve for a year.
Here are some of the issues I have experienced:
1.  Interviewers do not appear to be qualified for the positions for which they are conducting interviews. The most recent example is that I was scheduled for an interview for a Senior VP position (210540185 | Senior Lead Software Engineer - Python) with an interviewer whose job title is an associate engineer, not even a VP. Please see the interview info below. How can someone make a good hiring decision for a position he or she does not have enough experience with? The only explanation is that the aim of this interview is to reject me rather than employ me, but whoever assigned this associate engineer to interview for a senior VP position couldn't find a manager or engineer willing to lie for him or her throughout the interview and reject me. I believe this is also due to the quality of my recent ongoing interviews. My questions are, who sent an associate engineer to interview for a VP postion, and why?

2. The quality of my interviews are extremely low, with the clear purpose of removing my candidacy. Despite having had over 20 interviews, the majority of which were for technical roles, there are very few technical interviews. Most of the time, I've been interviewed and rejected by interviewers that don't have a software engineer or any other technical experience, with questions like "where I was born" and "what do I like to do when I'm not working". At some interviews, the interviewer's questions and description of job requirements are completely different from the requirements in the job posting, which fits great in my experience.
3. Delayed hiring process, resulting in positions being filled before my interview even begins. The delay is usually somewhere between 1- 4 weeks.  After offering a week of my full-day availability to the recruiter or scheduler who requested, I may not hear anything back.  If you check in with them, they may or may not inform you that they need you to update your availability in the last minute of your provided availability.
4. My candidacy was dropped, and my scheduled interviews were canceled without explanation on the interview day when I already joined the Zoom call and was about to have my interview .
5. Someone in your department changed my applicant profile and employment history at JPMC.  I was employed as a VP with full-time employment in 2021 and I was NEVER hired as a contractor or associate engineer, but I've been informed by multiple recruiters that they saw my profile as an associate engineer and a contractor.  I've been applying for jobs at JPMC almost everyday and always have a current resume on my profile, so why has my employment history become something else that I have never put on my resume? Who did that?
6. Strangely, recent interview requests beginning in April 2024 have consistently requested at the same time. There are always two or more requests that follow one another closely, almost as if they are competing. If I didn't move forward with one of them, the other interview requests would disappear.
7. I no longer receive updates on my interview status. I have not heard back from any recruiters on the interviews I had in June 2024. When I asked when I could expect to hear the interview results, one of my interviewers said they didn't know because once they made the selection, it's up to HR to decide when to arrange the next round. Could you help update my interview status for all the interviews I had back in June 2024?
For item 2 - 7, I can provide more details and examples with 5W(who, what, where, when, why) and 1H(How) if needed
I would very appreciate it if you could answer all of the questions and address these concerns above! Thank you.

HI Qiong,
Thanks for your response and your list of concerns that you've stated below. Though you would prefer contact via e-mail I think it's best suited that we talk live on the phone so please let me know when you're available.
One of the concerns that I have is the way that you addressed one of my recruiters in a highly inappropriate manner via e-mail so again I think our conversation is best done live.  My contact number is below or I can phone you directly.  Looking forward to hearing from you.

Hey,
Writing is the best way to elaborate and confirm your explanations. If you couldn't explain and address all the issues in the writing, I don't think you are willing to explain anything over the phone. So I'll have to ask for someone that can address the problems, perhaps your boss.
Inappropriate manners? What about some of your interviewers, who appeared aggressive towards me during the interview and nearly yelled at me for no apparent reason? Don't try to digress from what we're going to discuss there.  That only makes me believe you have no plans to resolve anything but to back whoever caused all of the problems!

I don't think someone can provide all of the details during a video conference. Because no one can remember all of the details and cannot show everything on the video conference, I documented them and can provide them to you by email if you can tell me what you want to know.  Also, writing is the most effective technique to elaborate and validate all of the details. If you can't ask queries in writing, I doubt you'll want to resolve them during the video call.

Updated question 4.
1. Why was the quality of your interviews low? Include the recruiter‚Äôs name, date of interview, comments made or questions asked, etc.
Here is an example of a low-quality interview in which the interviewer is rude, irrational, unprofessional, unfair, threatening and full of hatred.
I was not advised that a coding interview would require me to share my computer screen. The interview was originally set for 30 minutes, and I was told it would be with a hiring manager, who is typically a non-technical person based on my previous interview experience at JPMC.   Also, 30 minutes is too short for a coding session. So I didn't join the interview from my computer but my phone. On May 6, 2024, at 7:41 AM, the recruiter contacted me via email, saying,  ‚ÄúThe manager has requested to extend the interview an additional 30 minutes..‚Äù  See the following. When I woke up and received his email, it was less than an hour till my interview, and I still didn't know if there was a coding round that needed me to show my screen.
Then Dhira Kaleeswaran and another individual joined the zoom.  I was informed that another individual without her camera on will conduct the coding interview for Dhira Kaleeswaran. They required me to share my computer screen.  Asking candidates to share their screen for a coding interview without giving advance notice is very disrespectful about the candidate's data privacy and security.  I was shocked that she works in the security domain, yet doesn't seem to care about others' data privacy and security. I have taken numerous professional technical coding interviews, including FAANG, and I have never been asked to share my screen, let alone share it without giving notice.
Not only am I uncomfortable sharing my screen unprepared in an unsafe manner, but I also had an internet connectivity issue with my computer, so I asked Dhira Kaleeswaran if I could reschedule. She started to blame me and nearly yelled at me during the interview for not being able to join the Zoom coding session from my computer because of technical difficulties.  She even unreasonably brought the HR interview scheduler on the call to try to resolve my wifi issue.  She was rude and insane, suggesting that I either complete the interview today no matter what or be removed from consideration. Of course, the HR scheduler had no idea how to address my wifi issue. Like me, she didn't seem to know what this interview was about or what needed to be prepared for the interview. As a result, the interview couldn't proceed and couldn't be rescheduled, my application was no longer being considered. I received the rejection email almost immediately after I got off the zoom call with them. I‚Äôve never met her before and knew nothing about her. There is no reason for her to act crazy like a hater, unless she was told to.
Hi Qiong,
The manager has request to extend the interview an additional 30 minutes. Just wanted to keep you posted on this. Please keep in mind that they may not need the full hour however they wanted to extend the interview just in case.

3. You stated interviewer's questions and description of job requirements were different from the requirements in the job posting. Can you provide the interviewer‚Äôs name, date of interview, job you interviewed for, questions asked, etc.?
In the job post below, you can see the top skills/experience for these positions are : Advanced Python programming skills, API development, software development life cycle and pipeline, and knowledge and experience of security practices for enterprise applications/services.
The interviewer's questions are completely different from the requirements in the job description. I was not asked about my Python, API, software development experiences, and enterprise security solutions, which are the top skills described in the job description and fit great with my experience.   Even though the requirements in the description are quite clear about the skills/experience needed, the interviewer couldn't clarify the requirements. I was asked if I had built a SaaS program from scratch, but the interviewer stated that this was not standard software development work.  It's a little bit of everything: design, develop, config, onboard, secure applications, security engineer, integration of various services, etc.  Then I was asked if I felt comfortable not writing much code at work. I was wondering how I might create a SaaS application from scratch without writing much code?!

4. Any other examples where interviews were biased or you were treated unfairly?
Aside from the other reasons/examples stated in the answers to the rest of the questions 1, 2, 3, 5, 6: The quality of my interviews is low. The hiring process was delayed, resulting in positions being filled before my interview could begin. My candidacy was dropped, and my scheduled interviews were canceled without explanation on the interview day, even though I had already joined the Zoom call and was about to begin my interview. Here are three additional examples:
A. Someone from the HR department changed my applicant profile and employment history at JPMC.  I was employed as a VP with full-time employment in 2021 and I was NEVER hired as a contractor or associate engineer, but I've been informed by multiple recruiters that they saw my profile as an associate engineer and a contractor.  I've been applying for jobs at JPMC almost everyday and always have a current resume on my profile, so why has my employment history become something else that I have never put on my resume? Who did that?
B. I no longer receive updates on my interview status. I have not heard back from any recruiters on the interviews I had since June 2024. When I asked when I could expect to hear the interview results, one of my interviewers said they didn't know because once they made the selection, it's up to HR to decide when to arrange the next round.  I could have been selected from any earlier interviews, but they never kept me updated and scheduled the next round, thus I was never moved forward. I wrote multiple emails to vernadette.j.caga@jpmorgan.com and stephanie.colunga@jpmchase.com asking about application status but did not receive response.
C. Furthermore, there are strong indications that someone is attempting to keep me from being hired by undermining teams who wanted to interview me by purposely delaying their interview requests until after I have responded to any additional unexpected requests in order to send me to interviews where interviewers will never choose me at all. They've been doing this for months. The same pattern appears repeatedly. It's difficult to believe it wasn't true.
D.  Interviewers do not appear to be qualified for the positions for which they are conducting interviews. The most recent example is that I was scheduled for an interview for a Senior VP position (210540185 | Senior Lead Software Engineer - Python) with an interviewer whose job title is an associate engineer, not even a VP. Please see the interview info below. How can someone make a good hiring decision for a position he or she does not have enough experience with? The only explanation is that the aim of this interview is to reject me rather than hiring me. I believe that this is also the cause for the poor quality of my recent ongoing interviews. My questions are, who sent an associate engineer to interview for a VP position, and why?

5. Who would not respond to you after offering a week of your availability?
Many of my interviews were scheduled at the end of the last available day I provided, leaving me with no time to prepare for the interview. I sometimes have to email the recruiter again to see if my availability is still working for them after not hearing back from them till the end of my last available day. Not every interview is scheduled once I give my availability, and there's no explanation. Most recruiters do not contact me directly to explain roles or answer questions. Most of the time, schedulers send me an interview request inquiring for my availability without telling me who the recruiter is. Sometimes my provided availability was totally ignored without explanation. My interview was delayed to be scheduled, and they chose a day at random without even asking about my new availability.
I gave my availability from 6/26/24 to 6/28/24, 10am - 4pm CDT  to the recruiter Guzman, Trisha" <trisha.guzman@chase.com> , but the interview was scheduled on 07/03/24. I wasn't told or asked when the interview schedule needed to be adjusted.

6. Elaborate on ‚ÄúMy candidacy was dropped, and my scheduled interviews were canceled without explanation on the interview day when I already joined the Zoom call and was about to have my interview,including who, what role, dates, any context or explanation provided to you, etc.
I have an scheduled interview below but I never met my other two interviewers Gregory Griffis and John Griffis. Priyanka Patel joined the zoom call and canceled my application.
She claimed to be an advocate for women engineers.  She suggested she might have a better position than this one and wanted to refer me to, but I haven't heard from her since then. It was hard to believe they scheduled an interview by accident. Because it's quite unbelievable that the recruiter, manager, and the hiring team all made mistakes in failing to notice I don‚Äôt have Java experience on my resume or not evaluating my resume at all.

Hope you had a great weekend!

Hello,
Employee Relations is in the process of reviewing the concerns to address it accordingly based on firmwide standards. Once I have an update, I will provide one. This does take a few weeks.
devqm prowork.dev1010@gmail.com
Nov 8, 2024, 1:06‚ÄØPM (4 days ago)
to Anish
Hi Anish,
I wanted to follow up on our last communication about the issues I encountered during the hiring process. You advised me that I would receive a response in a few weeks, but it has been more than 2 months(3 months since submitting my initial request) and I still have not received anything. I'm wondering if you have any updates?  I'm still experiencing issues with the hiring process. See below.
Last week, Trisha Guzman, the recruiter called me on the phone.  I was stunned when she said my name as "Qiong Michaels Jeremy." I had previously mentioned in my email that someone had modified my employment history, but now it appears they've also changed my name in my profile as well? Had she not seen my resume? I've spoken with countless recruiters throughout the years. Never before has anyone called me without even knowing my name. I'd think she received incorrect information somewhere. Where is the incorrect information from?
Also, the job description was removed prior to the interview, but I was not provided any information other than the job title for which I am interviewing. My interviewer informed me that I was interviewing for a position on the forensic team. I don't recall seeing any job descriptions for the position I applied for that mentioned forensics. Despite the fact that the interviewer stated that this is still an engineering role and that I answered his questions well, I'm still concerned if the job description was changed on the fly, so the add-on forensic topic would be used as an excuse to reject me. I have not heard back from the recruiter after the interview.
Since I was wrongfully laid off in 2022, I've been applying for most software engineering-related positions almost every day, at least once a week or two, for about two years, and I have over ten years of experience, as well as so many teams(around 20-30) interested in interviewing me, how could I not be qualified for anything and be hired already? Are they all mistaken in selecting me, or are there HR personnel that continually prevent me from being hired?  Which one is more obvious to you? There are also other leadership positions on the development team. Why have I been repeatedly denied for those positions and instead selected for positions where I barely have expertise?
Based on the issues I raised in my previous email and above, it has occurred to me that individuals deliberately preventing me from being hired by the firm are most likely working at the Human Resources department.  Because none of the technical teams I interviewed for knew me, why would they reject me on purpose for no reason? The only individuals who knew me from the start (Even though I didn't know anyone at HR when I worked there, I wasn't sure why they wanted to fight me, unless they were some horrible soulless individuals who would hurt anyone to spread their hatred and jealousy) were the ones who wrongfully laid me off, and they have yet to be held accountable for what they did.  Because if they had, they would have stopped blocking from being hired already.
I would appreciate it if the firm can sort this out and stop such dishonest, unkind and aggressive behavior directed at me and possibly other employees. I still hope the firm will change for the better, and I would like to return to work.  Could you please let me know when I can expect an answer?  Thank you.
Best,
Qiong

Hi Anish,
Could you please explain how each of the submitted issues was addressed by Employee Relationships?
Since I submitted the request, the frequency of being selected for interviews has dropped dramatically from every week before to only one in the last 3 months, and some of the issues I submitted appear to be worsening rather than improving. In my most recent conversation with a recruiter Trisha Guzman, the recruiter called me with the wrong name on my candidate profile. How did this occur? Can you explain it in detail? Thanks.

Hi Anish,
I just wanted to follow up on the issue I communicated with you in my last email. I just caught this scheduler Aditi Nag lying by alleging I didn't show up for the interview, which is almost hilarious given that he clearly responded to my email I sent to him on the interview day, telling him I was waiting for the interviewer till the last minute, but no one joined the Zoom call. (see the email below or the attachment).  He did not respond until two days later with the email below, attempting to blame me by pretending I was not available for the interview.  Is there anything you can do to stop such hostile behavior? I don't even know him and anyone else working in your HR department. Why do they keep sabotaging my interviews and attacking me?

Of course, the role is on hold. I've heard the same execuse so many times, especially as I was prepared to accept the offer.
Finally, this time they were unable to find anyone on the engineer team who was ready to lie for them and reject me. It's been two years. It's amazing that none of the interviews I had were truly technical. Instead, I've been rejected by non-technical persons for interviews that make no sense. That's how they ruined all my internal and external opportunities and offers, as well as my reputation, with their lies and scams in the past two years since I was laid off for no apparent reason. As a result, I went from having recruiters from every company calling me every day to nearly zero by now. Take a look at who they've hired in the HR department: dishonest and cheating people who lie/BS in front of you without shame! And they're still despicable psychos who can't leave me alone! Who manages the human resources department, allowing and encouraging extremely biased, unlawful, unethical behavior? How have you proved your commitment to equal opportunity and inclusion?

Hi Whitney,
I just saw the email you sent yesterday. I'm unavailable today, December 18 from 12:00pm to 1:00pm CST. I'm unable to attend on such short notice, with only a few hours. Please give me at least one or two days' notice. I provided full day and full time availability last week, but I'm not sure why the interview was not scheduled, and no one informed me that it needed to be rescheduled for this week.  The only time I'm available this week is Friday afternoon, but I can cancel my therapy appointment in the morning to accommodate you.  So I can do it on Friday, December 20, 10:30am-5pm CDT. Let me know if this works for you. Thanks.

Hi,
I wanted to follow up with the profile issue I had earlier. It is still not resolved. I'm not able to see job applications on my candidate profile.
See attached screenshots.  Furthermore,the recruiting has become worse, and it seems to be a scam. Despite providing my availability to the recruiter months ago, and the recruiter stated she will send an invite for an interview, my interview was never scheduled. Instead, I just received a rejection email indicating they had interviewed me and thanked me for meeting them?!!!!

Another issue is recruiters keep cold calling me without sending a job description, and my profile isn't functional, so I can't view the job I applied for. They then asked me to accept a salary range that is significantly lower than the specified range for this position. Of course, I'll say no, giving them an excuse to reject me.  That sounds like a setup to reject me or a scam!

During the interview for Senior Lead Security Engineer - Cloud Security (210541099), I was asked if I had any expertise with security engineering and security architecture. I answered I had a lot of experience with web API/application security, cloud security, endpoint security, and enterprise network security architecture. I provided a overview of the architecture for enterprise network security and discussed some recommended practices for protecting API services. The interviewer said, "I get it," before I could go into further detail about client/server related attacks. Other questions include why I wanted to return to JPMorgans and whether it's okay if I focus my attention to security rather than development, which involves more coding. I said, "It's okay, at all." I enjoy doing the security-related tasks. Despite the hiring challenges noted above, there are folks at JPMC who want to make positive changes and provide me and possibly others with opportunities to interview and get hired again. I would love to work with people like that!

Hi Reed,
You probably can see I have applied to other job positions. Would you please also share my profile for this position -  Senior Manager of Security Engineering - Employee Compute 210514292 Houston, TX, United States ? This role requires Python, which fits better than the other one (Senior Manager of Software Engineering: 210524119) based on the job description. If you have reviewed my resume, you will see I have a lot of Python experience. Thanks

Also, I wanted to share an interesting fact with you: most of the jobs I applied for at JPMorgan that required Python were immediately rejected, despite the fact that I have 10+ years of Python coding experience and am almost entirely Python-centric if you look at my resume, but I received a number of interviews that required skills that are not my strong suit.  I even received a question like "Tell me what skills you have that are not on your resume" during the most recent interview I had.  Why do candidates need a resume if the skills on the resume don't count at all? That means the hiring process might be based on someone's personal choice, rather than having equal standards for everyone?
Best,
Qiong

Team 2
Trisha" trisha.guzman@chase.com called me on 6/24 asked for my availability for the current week, I gave here my availability for the entire week. however, somehow the interview was scheduled a week later not the date/time I gave to her. There's always a someone's mistake in the hiring process. I'd be surprised if there isn't any. This is a very non-technical interview with the following question: What is not on your resume? I was wondering why the HR department would ever gather resumes if the interviewer they sent was going to ask a question like this. Then she began to protest, despite my familarity/expertise with their projects and internal tools, but there are changes. Then I asked, " What are the changes?" She mentioned, for example, that we switched from . net to .com LOL. Great questions from HR?

Another Team2:
The recruiter "Colunga, Stephanie" stephanie.colunga@jpmchase.com called me on 7/01 and asked whether I was interested in and available for another position. The interview wasn't horrible. There were some technical questions, but again, seems the objective was to buffle someone with questions rather than evaluate their technical capability. The questions are LRU cache and decorator implementation. The questions were basic but it's probably better to use the built-in methods from rare modules such as timeit, so I kind of needed to refresh my memory and check the doc. I couldn't do that at the interview, so I just did some calculations with the time module and solved it. Since they did not share a link or request that I prepare to share my screen ahead of time, so I had to tell them the answers rather than writing them down. I built far more sophisticated code than these examples. They knew, and I have proof. They never seem to want to admit it. Hide my commited/released code, the comments, and requested that I change the working code to the terrible code that does not work and much more. Some of the engineers/leads I used to work with barely have any coding skills.

Like the previous two teams, as soon as I was rejected from team 1, all of the chasing recruiters from team 2 stopped their pursuit as well, despite the fact that they were recruiting for completely different roles.
I was rejected by team1:

Staffing agency(Genesis10 == SCAM) and HR at Bank of America are even worse! Egh...
Ever since I left with them, everything has been oddly against me. Many opportunities seem to vanish as quickly as they come. Strangely, no recruiters have gotten in touch with me on LinkedIn since then, despite the fact that I've received emails from recruiters asking for interviews. Shortly after that, my LinkedIn account was deleted for no reason, and I was unable to create a new one using my full name. I have tried this, then the new account was restricted too. I can't get in touch with people on LinkedIn about jobs, and I can't even be found in the search engines, especially in Google. Even though I have been in contact with LinkedIn support for months and have verified with PERSONA multiple times, their support has not yet addressed my concerns, and I am currently still waiting for a response. This has been an endless cycle.
I am not inexperienced. In fact, I was a popular candidate before working for them, but after leaving and rejecting their FTE offer, I haven't had an offer in about a year now. I can't see how any other kids just starting out would ever get employed again if they were in the similar situation as me. Those folks appear to have the ability to rig the labor market, restrict you from networking and ruin your career through their HR networks and partnerships. Who wants to work for an agency or organization that not only does not recognize the excellent work you did for them, but also twisted truths slandering you and generating such a tremendous detrimental influence on your career? What kind of folks are they?! How did they establish such a network? Why has no one spoken out against them or even investigated and stopped them from rigging the labor market? Despite the fact that they are undoubtedly there.
They can hire a lot of folks to lie for them and conceal the facts/the truth for a while, but no one can erase the facts/the truth from the face of the earth. Because the lies lack logic. There are always logic flaws with lying. Ask the HR at Bank of America how they determined that I had performance concerns, given that my supervisor has no coding abilities and can hardly understand the code I wrote. All of my code was tested by me and released by other teams. Ask the HR at JPMC why my performance changed dramatically in a couple of months from team star with a performance raise(because I addressed the problem that has been puzzled everyone for a year or more) to someone who does not match performance standards at all with a written warning. I've been working hard for years, but all of a sudden I've decided I don't want to work hard any more after I just received some incentive? Ask the HR at Google why my contract was terminated. Is this because I told them that my lead lied and secretly reported me for missing work for six weeks(Never brought up with me), despite the fact that I had just spoken with him and had been having meetings with my project manager and even the HR manager the entire time?
I have not mentioned these bad experience I had at work. Not because I'm afraid of them, but because I still appreciated the opportunities I've been given, and despite that, I enjoyed my time in the office working on projects with their teams, but after all that happened, I lost interest in working for them a long time ago. As you may have heard, there's no doubt that those HR departments are far from being good ones. They did not solve any problems but created a lot of drama. They are skilled at creating dramas until all of the people they dislike leave the company. That's why the culture is bad!
Maybe nobody cares, but I'll keep nagging them until someone does, or until we all work together to fix this and return rules/orders and services to how they should be. We want our good doctors to return to work or make more money, so that many lives can be saved. We want our good car/plane/ship engineers/mechanics return to work and make more money, so we don't have accidents due to bad designs/engineering. We want our reliable/good banking services back so that our hard-earned savings don't turn into nothing due to inflation and homes don't turn into million-dollar shacks that no one can afford to buy or rebuild. We want our troops back to protect us, not mercenaries who are not even citizens. More importantly, we want the technologies in which we have invested, designed and produced to be in the hands of our engineers, not controlled by or dependent on foreigners in another country or here. God bless America and the people who make freedom a reality!

LinkedIn: I can't use Linkedin. LinkedIn blocks me from looking for jobs by restricting my accounts after they are setup.
I suspect LinkedIn sends viruses via the account verification link. It seems immediately after verifying my account with their verification link, it is then restricted.
If you don't believe me, try to use my name to create a LinkedIn account with my employment history, the keep applying for software engineer or management job listings on LinkedIn and see what happens. You should get restricted in less than a week.
The same thing happened to me on Facebook. The account with my real name is restricted for no apparent reason. LOL
